# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The issue is that a query like `{ field: { $in: [] } }` will always return an empty result set, even if the `field` might contain `null`, `undefined` or other values. This can be confusing for developers who expect the query to return all documents when the `$in` array is empty.

The solution presented handles this edge case appropriately by modifying the query to return all documents if the array is empty.   See the `bugSolution.js` for the solution.
